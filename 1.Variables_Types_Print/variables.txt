Remember:
Use meaningful and easy-to-remember variable names 
(E.g maths_mark = 49 is easier to understand than x = 49)

Variable names must start with a character not a number

Variable names must not contain spaces
(Use under_scores or CapitalLetters instead)

Python commands cannot be used as variable names 
(E.g for, with, is, return, etc.) """

Which of these compile?

1. hello = 10
2. 1mark = 100
3. math mark = 20
4. math100 = 0.0
5. 123 = "onetwothree"
6. onetwothree = 123
7. vArIaBlE = True
8. for = "four"
9. -10 = "negative 10"
10. x_x = -900
